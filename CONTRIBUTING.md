# How to Contribute

Thank you for your interest in ENN_ACME. The primary goal of open-sourcing
ENN_ACME was to allow us to open-source our research more easily. Unfortunately,
we are not currently able to accept pull requests from external contributors,
though we hope to do so in future. Please feel free to open GitHub issues.

Note that you are free to start a fork of the project for your purposes as
permitted by the license.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License

contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your
contributions as part of the project. Head over to
<https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see your current agreements on file or

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.
