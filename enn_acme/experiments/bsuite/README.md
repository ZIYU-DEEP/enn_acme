# Varying ENN design on bsuite

This experiment runs a single-process DQN variant on `bsuite`.

- Loads ENN design from [`neural_testbed`](https://github.com/deepmind/neural_testbed)
- Forms a single-process DQN using these architectures.
- Evaluates the agent on bsuite.
- See `bsuite` section of "Epistemic Neural Networks" [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08924).
