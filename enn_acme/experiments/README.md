# Example experiments

This folder contains examples of experiments that run using `enn_acme`.

- `bsuite`: evaluates a DQN variant on [`bsuite`](https://github.com/deepmind/bsuite) using different ENN architectures. Reproduces `bsuite` results for ["Epsitemic Neural Networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08924).
